      <p>1: This is the datasheet for the n-mosfet transistor: https://www.diodes.com/assets/Datasheets/DMT6009LCT.pdfLinks 
        to an external site.f What is the absolute maximum amount of current between pins 2 and 3?</p>

      <p>2: Draw a schematic for a circuit with using at least your arduino, a DC motor, a flyback diode, 
        and capacitors between power and ground. Find parts with datasheets you could use for each of these 
        schematic components.</p>

      <p>3: Here is the datasheet for the L293D chip: https://www.ti.com/product/L293DLinks 
        to an external site.. Draw a schematic using at least your arduino, this chip, and 
        two motors. Write (pseudo) code that shows how you would move the motors both forward, 
        both back, then one forward one back, and one back then forward.</p>

      <p>4: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? If yes, please provide 
      details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. If you used an LLM, 
      please 'share' your conversation and include it as part of your submission, 
      or cite the prompt(s) you used and the output. If no, you can either leave this 
      question blank, or provide other information if you'd like.</p>
