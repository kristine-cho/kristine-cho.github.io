    <h2> Questions</h2>
    <p>1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</p>
    <p>2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw? </p>
    <p>3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking? </p>
    <p>4: 5: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? If yes, please provide details on how/when, 
        as well as a brief reflection. If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide 
        other information if you'd like.</p>
