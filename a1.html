      <p1>The 220Ω resistors are used to limit the current going through the LEDs to prevent them from burning out. 
        I chose the 220Ω resistors because my calculations showed me that I would need a resistor of at least 160Ω
        to keep the current below 20mA, which is the desired current for these LEDs. Since I do not have a 160Ω resistor,
        I chose to use a 220Ω resistor, which is the next closest and safest option available in my kit.

      <p>Schematic</p>
      <p1> I made the 3 schematics not connected to each other because I wanted to show that each 
        LED is connected to a different pin on the Arduino so that they can blink independently.
        I made these schematics shorthand to show the circuit clearly and simply.

      <p>Circuit's Operation gif</p>
      <p1> I used 3 LEDs, 3 resistors, and an Arduino to create a blinking circuit.
          Each LED is connected to a different pin on the Arduino so that they can blink independently. 
          My circuit runs with a 0.5 second timer, turning a light on for 0.5 seconds and off for 
          0.5 seconds and goes through each lightbulb in rotation.</p1>

      <h2> Code Snippet</h2>
      <pre>
        <code>
        // initializing a timer for 1 second
        int timer = 500; 

        // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
        void setup() {
          // for loop initializing pins 10-12 as an output
          for (int thisPin = 10; thisPin < 13; thisPin++){
            // initializing thisPin as an output
            pinMode(thisPin, OUTPUT);
          }
        }

        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        void loop() {
          // forloop for turning each pin on and off from pin 10-12
          for (int thisPin = 10; thisPin < 13; thisPin++) {
            //turns on the LED by making the voltage high
            digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);
            //waits 1 second
            delay(timer);
            //turns off the LED by making the voltage low
            digitalWrite(thisPin, LOW);
            //waits 1 second
            delay(timer);
          }
        }</code>

      <h2> Questions</h2>
      <p>1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</p>
      <img src="blinkVTgraph-kacho-2.jpg" />
      <p>2: How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw? </p>
      <p1> I know we have 14 pins, from 0-13, but when I try plugging them all in with LEDs,
        I could only get 13 pins to blink individually. Pin 0 would constantly stay on without blinking even when it was 
        a part of my for-loop. This circuit would draw 14.5mA of current if we calculate the current using Ohms law.

      <p>3: How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking? </p>
      <p1> With my timer being 3ms, I am unable to tell that my lights are blinking. I found this out by
        decreasing the timer in my code until I could no longer see the lights blinking. </p1>
      <p>4: Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? If yes, please provide details on how/when, 
        as well as a brief reflection. If no, you can either leave this question blank, or provide 
        other information if you'd like.</p>
      <p1>I did not use AI in this assignment!</p1>
